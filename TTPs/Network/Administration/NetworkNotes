TTs:

TO1, TT.a
Investigate network traffic for exfiltration
- Where did we fall short?

TO1, TT.b
Investigate network traffic for lateral movement


TO1, TT.c
Investigate network traffic for beaconing/C2


TO1, TT.h (will only come into play later)
Develop kill-chain analysis
- Work with host team to combine information


TO2, TT.a
Perform network blocking mechanisms to stop MCA


TO3, TT.a
Recommend network security measures to prevent future MCA


TO4, TT.a
Confirm discovered MCA is no longer present in network traffic


TO5, TT.a
Confirm implementation of hardening actions through threat emulation



Big Rocks

Day 1

- Analyst needed some training building Kibana dashboards, took some time out of Hunt mission

- Host and Network team spent 45 minutes investigating traffic generated by a member of the Host Team

- Mismanagement of personnel based on strengths and current tasks assigned

Day 2

- Rabbit Holes

- Didn’t do OpCheck of DIP sensors (comprehensive DIP services check)

- Vms went down during Vul Window, consider rebooting Vms before start of Vul Window, as part of OpsCheck processes

- Did not find any verified MCA (Not proficient on tools, room for improvement on processes)

- Didn’t submit Tasks in Redmine in real time

Day 3

- ACAS wasn’t working; DOM fixed it
- No one knew how to configure Firewall. Lacked experience with VyOS.

Firewall configuration almost didn’t get done within Vul Window.
