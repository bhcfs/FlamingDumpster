Big Rocks

Day 1

- Analyst needed some training building Kibana dashboards, took some time out of Hunt mission

- Host and Network team spent 45 minutes investigating traffic generated by a member of the Host Team

- Mismanagement of personnel based on strengths and current tasks assigned

Day 2

- Rabbit Holes

- Didn’t do OpCheck of DIP sensors (comprehensive DIP services check)

- Vms went down during Vul Window, consider rebooting Vms before start of Vul Window, as part of OpsCheck processes

- Did not find any verified MCA (Not proficient on tools, room for improvement on processes)

- Didn’t submit Tasks in Redmine in real time

Day 3

- ACAS wasn’t working; DOM fixed it
- No one knew how to configure Firewall. Lacked experience with VyOS.

Firewall configuration almost didn’t get done within Vul Window.
